# LCAAJ / Language and Culture Archive of Ashkenazic Jewry

The [LCAAJ](https://guides.library.columbia.edu/lcaaj) (Language and Culture Archive of Ashkenazic Jewry) 
was a multi-decade project, 
started by [Uriel Weinreich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel_Weinreich) 
and originally titled “Atlas,” not “Archive.” The LCAAJ recorded Yiddish 
language use and Ashkenazic culture across Europe. 
Over 600 speakers of Yiddish were recorded responding to 2500 questions, 
creating 5755 hours of tape. 
[Three volumes of the atlas](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1231536) were published, 
out of five planned.

Notably, the project was an early beneficiary of computational organization. 
Two grants, awarded in 1961 and 1962, were designated to 
“explore the possibilities of utilizing electronic data-processing 
machinery for the storage, filing, sorting, 
and searching of the accumulating field materials of the atlas.”

Unfortunately, though the data from the interviews, 
including phonetic transcriptions, was input into the computers of the time,
no copy of the data exists other than in printout. 

This GitHub group serves as a place where we can work with the data of the LCAAJ
as we breathe new life into the project.
